# CargoShippingOptimization
 Network Flow Optimization with PulP

It generates solutions to which shipping companies must be selected while sending cargo from node A to B in a cost effective way.

For instance, when you want to send cargo from Turkey to Germany, you may send directly but it could be expensive. Instead of doing that you could choose to send Turkey to Bulgaria with cargo company X, then Bulgaria to Germany with cargo company Y with less cost.
